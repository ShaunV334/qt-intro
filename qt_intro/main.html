        <h1>🌌 Quantum Heist — The Mission Begins</h1>
        <p>In a not-so-distant future, the world’s most powerful microcontroller — <strong>Qubit-X</strong> — has been developed, capable of breaking any encryption and unlocking the most secure systems. Hidden within the high-security labs of Quantum Corp, this chip holds secrets that could either save humanity or plunge it into chaos.</p>
        
        <p>But there’s a twist — Quantum Corp isn’t as noble as they seem. An insider has leaked intel that the corporation plans to sell the chip to the highest bidder, regardless of the consequences.</p>

        <p>You and your team are part of an elite group of rogue scientists, codenamed <strong>4213</strong>, tasked with infiltrating the lab, retrieving the Qubit-X chip, and escaping undetected.</p>
